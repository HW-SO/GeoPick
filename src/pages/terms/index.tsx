                            You should be aware that there are certain things that GeoPicK will not take responsibility
                            for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet
                            connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but
                            GeoPicK cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you
                            don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
                        {/* </p> */}
                        {' '}
                        <br/>

                        <br/>
                        {/* <p> */}
                            If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms
                            of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be
                            charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
                            while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                            responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app
                            outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                            you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware
                            that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

                            Along the same lines, GeoPicK cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app
                            i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
                            you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, GeoPicK cannot accept responsibility.

                            With respect to GeoPicK’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app,
                            it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
                            correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we
                            can make it available to you. GeoPicK accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
                            you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

                            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android &
                            iOS – the requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend
                            the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you
                            want to keep using the app. GeoPicK does not promise that it will always update the app so
                            that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have
                            installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application
                            when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it
                            at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon
                            any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you
                            must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
