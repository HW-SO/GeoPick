## Using Zeplin
For developing the application from the designs, we will be using [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/), a popular framework for developer handoff. Zeplin also has integrations with **Microsoft teams** and **Jira**, and therefore will be easier for commenting on the interfaces.

### How to use Zeplin?
1. Make an account using [this link](https://zeplin.io/).
2. After you make an account, **send me your Email ID** so that i can add you in the team.
3. Zeplin has a desktop application and a website. Although both can be used, i encourage you to install the desktop application.
4. After that, you can click on this [link](https://zpl.io/adgnjQl) to view the interfaces on the web or this [link](zpl://project?pid=5f8c16f1aa30b9bd20afa74f) to view it on the desktop application.
5. All the interfaces will be readily available in zeplin for coding.

Each interface is in read-only mode, so the designs cannot be modified. Hold CTRL key + mouse to hover on components.Zeplin has a lot of extensions for ease in development.

### Using extensions
1. In the dashboard (where you can view all the interfaces), locate the keyword **Extensions** in the right-side pane.
2. Click on the **settings icon** to view all available extensions.
3. In the popup dialog box, click on **Explore Extensions**. In case you cannot find it, use this [link](https://extensions.zeplin.io/) to add extensions.
4. Search for CSS or React extensions and add them

After setting up all of this, you can go back to the dashboard in zeplin and click on any interface. After the interface loads, you can click on any component and a custom code will be generated based on the component selected.

## Interface components
This folder consists of **2 sub-folders**:

- [SVGs](#SVGs)
- [PNGs](#PNGs)

### SVGs
As you know SVGs are scalable vector graphics and these are similar to XML files. For building the application, we will be using **SVG files only**. All the SVGs are named after the components used in the interfaces, which can be found in Zeplin. This will make it easier for finding the appropriate SVG files.

### PNGs
**PNG files will not be used for building the application** due to it's pixelating nature. These files have the same name as the SVG files and are used only to identify or verify the correct SVG files.
